`mcpredomics` is an R package for interpretable multiclass classification of metagenomic data.  
It extends the [`predomics`](https://github.com/predomics/predomicspkg) framework by adapting its genetic algorithm-based heuristics to multiclass problems using One-vs-One (OvO) and One-vs-All (OvA) strategies.

This package is particularly suited for microbiome classification tasks where both **accuracy** and **interpretability** are critical.  
It provides reproducible methods and visualization tools to compare multiple strategies, constraints, and model structures.

> **Note:** Although the package is named `mcpredomics`, the development repository is named [`predomicsmc`](https://github.com/UMMISCO/predomicsmc).
