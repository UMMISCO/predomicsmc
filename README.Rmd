`mcpredomics` is an R package for interpretable multiclass classification of metagenomic data.  
It extends the [`predomics`](https://github.com/predomics/predomicspkg) framework by adapting its genetic algorithm-based heuristics to multiclass problems using One-vs-One (OvO) and One-vs-All (OvA) strategies.

This package is particularly suited for microbiome classification tasks where both **accuracy** and **interpretability** are critical.  
It provides reproducible methods and visualization tools to compare multiple strategies, constraints, and model structures.

> **Note:** Although the package is named `mcpredomics`, the development repository is named [`predomicsmc`](https://github.com/UMMISCO/predomicsmc).

## Installation

To install the development version of `mcpredomics` from GitHub:

```r
# Install required dependencies
install.packages(c("doSNOW", "foreach", "snow", "doRNG", "gtools", 
                   "glmnet", "pROC", "viridis", "kernlab", "randomForest"))

# Install BioQC from Bioconductor
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("BioQC")

# Install predomics (required dependency)
install.packages("predomics")

# Install mcpredomics from GitHub
devtools::install_github("UMMISCO/predomicsmc")


## Package File Presentation

The package is organized into several main folders and files:

- vignettes/ 
  Contains tutorials and statistical analyses:  
  - `Analyse_Resultat_Finale.Rmd`: Includes all statistical summaries of our experiments, as well as statistical analyses performed with linear mixed-effects models.  
  - `my_vignette.Rmd`: Demonstrates how to launch an experiment, including an example using the colorectal cancer dataset.  
  - Additionally, this folder contains four Excel files with descriptive statistics of experimental performances for the following datasets: Enterotypes, Balanced Enterotypes, CRC, and T2D.  

- data/  
  Contains packaged datasets and experiment results:  
  - `mc.input.rda`: The Enterotype dataset.  
  - A collection of other multiclass datasets, whose details are described in `my_vignette.Rmd`.  
  - A dataframe storing all tested experimental results.  

- R/  
  Contains the main functions of the package:  
  - `globale_mc.R`: Core multiclass functions, aggregation methods, and evaluation utilities.  
  - `global_visuel.R`: Visualization functions (e.g., `plotModel_mc`).  
  - `terBeam_mc.R`: Implementation of the multiclass extension of the terBeam classifier.  
  - `terga1_mc.R`: Implementation of the multiclass extension of the terga1 classifier.  
  - `terbeam_lib_mc.R`: Support library functions for the multiclass terBeam classifier.  
  - `predomics_mc.R`: Contains the multiclass version of `fit()`, the classifier execution, and multiclass cross-validation procedures.  
  - `sota_analyse.R`: Implements baseline (SOTA) methods, both in native form and with OvA/OvO binarization. These functions are commented by default and can be uncommented if needed.  

- archives/ 
  A draft folder used to store example scripts that were considered useful to keep for reference.
