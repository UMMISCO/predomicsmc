\title{Melt a list of score vectors for plotting}
\usage{
meltScoreList_mc(v = v.prop, prepare.for.graph = TRUE, topdown = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{A named list of numeric vectors. Each vector must have the same length and named elements.}

\item{prepare.for.graph}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, scores for the group "-1" are multiplied by -1 (default: \code{TRUE}).}

\item{topdown}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the factor levels of the \code{name} column are reversed (top-down order) based on \code{names(v$all)} (default: \code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with columns: \code{name} (feature names), \code{score} (numeric values),
and \code{group} (group label from the list \code{v}).
}
\description{
This function transforms a named list of score vectors (e.g., prevalence scores)
into a melted \code{data.frame} suitable for plotting. The values corresponding to
class -1 can be inverted (multiplied by -1) for better visualization.
}
\details{
This function is useful for transforming proportion or importance scores (e.g., feature scores)
into a tidy format for visualization using \code{ggplot2} or other plotting systems. It assumes that
\code{v} is a list of named vectors and that one of the entries is named "all" to define factor levels.
