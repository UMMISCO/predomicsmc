)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix of input features.}

\item{y}{A vector of target labels.}

\item{clf}{A classifier object containing parameters, coefficients, and feature correlations.}

\item{approch}{A string specifying the approach ("ovo" or other supported approaches).}

\item{aggregation_}{A string specifying the aggregation method (e.g., "votingAggregation").}

\item{constrained}{Logical indicating whether to constrain feature selection.}
}
\value{
A list containing generated models, selected features, and evaluation results.
}
\description{
This function performs a multi-class model fitting based on ternary or binary languages,
and supports different objectives such as correlation and accuracy. It handles feature selection,
model generation, and evaluation for specified sparsity levels.
