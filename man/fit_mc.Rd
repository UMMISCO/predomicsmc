\arguments{
\item{X}{Dataset to classify}

\item{y}{Variable to predict}

\item{clf}{The classifier object containing the settings of the classifier}

\item{cross.validate}{Whether or not the classification should be run in
cross-validation mode (default: TRUE)}

\item{lfolds}{The folds to be used for the cross-validation}

\item{nfolds}{The number of folds to use in the cross-validation. If lfolds
are not specified this option allows to set them up (default: 10)}

\item{parallelize.folds}{Switch setting the parallelization mode based on
cross-validation folds and nothing else in the algorithm (default: TRUE).
This is much more efficient.}

\item{compute.importance}{The importance of variables in the learning process
during cross-validation can be computed. This is based on data perturbation
similar to the mean decrease accuracy in the random forest algorithm. Moreover,
this gives feature prevalence in models during CV (default: TRUE)}

\item{return.all}{Should all results from the cross-validation steps be
returned. This is usually needed when testing stability of the models
(default: FALSE)}

\item{log.file}{The output file for parallel logs (default: 'parallel.log')}

\item{approch}{The classification approach to use, such as "ova" (one-vs-all)
or "ovo" (one-vs-one) (default: "ova")}

\item{aggregation_}{The aggregation method used for combining results from
binary models in multi-class classification (default: "Predomics_aggregation_ova")}

\item{path}{The path where to save temporary data}

\item{constrained}{Logical flag indicating whether the classification should
be constrained (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{

classification results as a sub-element
}
\description{
This function runs a learning experiment based on the classifier
object and the given dataset.
