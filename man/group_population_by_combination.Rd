\title{Group model population by combination index}
\usage{
group_population_by_combination(pop)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{A list of model populations indexed by sparsity level. Each element contains multiple models,
and each model contains several pairwise combinations (e.g., A vs B, A vs C).}
}
\value{
A named list where each entry (e.g., "comb_1", "comb_2", ...) contains all submodels
corresponding to the same combination across all sparsity levels.
}
\description{
Structures a list of predomics models into a grouped collection based on their combination index,
regardless of their sparsity level.
}
